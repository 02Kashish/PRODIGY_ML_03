# svm-and-cnn-for-cats-vs-dogs
This study explores the complementary roles of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in image classification tasks. SVM is utilized primarily for classification, leveraging its ability to delineate decision boundaries between classes. Meanwhile, CNN excels in feature extraction, capturing intricate patterns and representations from raw image data. By integrating SVM for classification and CNN for feature extraction, a synergistic approach is achieved, enhancing the overall classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this hybrid methodology, showcasing improved accuracy and robustness in classifying images of cats and dogs. This approach optimally leverages the strengths of both SVM and CNN, offering a balanced solution for image classification
tasks.
